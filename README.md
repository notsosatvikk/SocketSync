## **How to Run**  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket-sync.git
   cd socket-sync
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**:  
   Use the following command to compile the Java files:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:  
   Start the server to handle client connections:  
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```

4. **Run the Clients**:  
   Connect clients to the server:  
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```

5. **Schedule Events**:  
   Clients can schedule events, which are synchronized in real-time across all connected clients.
